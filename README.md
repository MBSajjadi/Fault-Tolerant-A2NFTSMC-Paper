This project focuses on the active fault-tolerant control of a quadrotor UAV encountering both actuator and structural faults, simultaneously. Several simulations have been performed indicating the incredible robustness of the proposed control method of Active Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (A2NFTSMC)
