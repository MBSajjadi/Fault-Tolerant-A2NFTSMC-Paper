# üöÄ Active Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Non-singular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control of a Quadrotor UAV with Motor Thrust Deviation and Actuator Fault

This project focuses on the active fault-tolerant control of a quadrotor UAV encountering both actuator and structural faults, simultaneously. Several simulations have been performed indicating the incredible robustness of the proposed control method of Active Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Nonsingular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (A2NFTSMC).

We have developed a novel **Active Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Non-singular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control** integrated with a **Fault Detection and Identification (FDI)** unit, aiming to achieve trajectory tracking and fault reconstruction. A number of simulations performed in MATLAB for small and severe faults demonstrate the remarkable capability of the proposed control framework in trajectory tracking and path following, exhibiting rapid convergence

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fault Description and System Dynamics

There exist probable conditions during flight in which quadrotors may experience a collision with other aircraft, a tree, or another object. This impact causes the PLOE of a motor due to the propeller damage and the deviation of the motor. Consequently, the faulty motor force no longer acts in the vertical direction, and its effectiveness will also be reduced. Hence, actuator and structural faults are inevitable. As a result, quadrotor dynamics must be accordingly derived to account for both structural fault (motor deviation) and actuator fault (the effectiveness alleviation of thrust). The demonstration of the aforementioned faults is depicted in the Figure.
According to the the Figure, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ denote the fault angles, and $\eta$ represents the loss of effectiveness factor of an actuator where $\eta=0$ denotes no actuator fault, $\eta=1$ means the complete failure of an actuator, and $0<\eta<1$ represents the PLOE of an actuator, respectively.
The Assumptions regarding the mathematical modeling are described as follows:

**Assumption 1.** The position of the center of mass is constant after the fault occurrence.

**Assumption 2.** The symmetry of the moment of inertia will not change after the fault occurrence.

**Assumption 3.** After the fault occurrence, the moment of inertia and the mass value of the drone will not change.

The deflections from vertical directions add additional nonlinear terms to the system dynamics mathematically expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ddot{x} &= (s_{\phi}s_{\psi} + c_{\phi} s_{\theta} c_{\psi}) \frac{u_T}{m} - \frac{K_f}{m} \dot{x} + f_{stx} \\
\ddot{y} &= (-s_{\phi} c_{\psi} + c_{\phi} s_{\theta} s_{\psi}) \frac{u_T}{m} - \frac{K_f}{m} \dot{y} + f_{sty} \\
\ddot{z} &= -g + (c_{\phi} c_{\theta}) \frac{u_T}{m} - \frac{K_f}{m} \dot{z} + f_{stz} \\
\ddot{\phi} &= \left(\frac{I_y - I_z}{I_x}\right) \dot{\theta} \dot{\psi} + \frac{J_{TP}}{I_x} \dot{\theta} \omega^* + \frac{u_\phi}{I_x} - \frac{K_tL}{I_x} \dot{\phi} + f_{st\phi} \\
\ddot{\theta} &= \left(\frac{I_z - I_x}{I_y}\right) \dot{\phi} \dot{\psi} - \frac{J_{TP}}{I_y} \dot{\phi} \omega^* + \frac{u_\theta}{I_y} - \frac{K_tL}{I_y} \dot{\theta} + f_{st\theta} \\
\ddot{\psi} &= \left(\frac{I_x - I_y}{I_z}\right) \dot{\phi} \dot{\theta} + \frac{u_\psi}{I_z} - \frac{K_tL}{I_z} \dot{\psi} + f_{st\psi}
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_{stx} &= \frac{b}{m} \omega_2^2 \left( f_1 \cos\theta \cos\psi + f_2 (\cos\psi \sin\phi \sin\theta - \cos\phi \sin\psi) + f_3 (\sin\phi \sin\psi + \cos\phi \cos\psi \sin\theta) \right) \\
f_{sty} &= \frac{b}{m} \omega_2^2 \left( f_1 \cos\theta \sin\psi + f_2 (\sin\psi \sin\phi \sin\theta + \cos\phi \sin\psi) + f_3 (-\sin\phi \cos\psi + \cos\phi \sin\psi \sin\theta) \right) \\
f_{stz} &= \frac{b}{m} \omega_2^2 \left( -f_1 \sin\theta + f_2 (\sin\phi \cos\theta) + f_3 (\cos\phi \cos\theta) \right) \\
f_{st\phi} &= \frac{J_{TP}}{I_x} \omega_2 (f_2 \dot{\psi} - f_3 \dot{\theta}) + \frac{1}{I_x} \omega_2^2 (b l f_4 + f_1 d) \\
f_{st\theta} &= \frac{J_{TP}}{I_y} \omega_2 (f_1 \dot{\psi} + f_3 \dot{\phi}) + \frac{1}{I_y} \omega_2^2 (b l f_5 - f_2 d) \\
f_{st\psi} &= -\frac{J_{TP}}{I_z} \omega_2 (f_2 \dot{\phi} + f_1 \dot{\theta}) - \frac{1}{I_z} \omega_2^2 (b l f_6 + f_3 d)
\end{aligned}
$$

and fault related terms regarding the fault angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_1 &= \sin\alpha \sin\gamma \\
f_2 &= -\cos\gamma \sin\beta + \sin\gamma \cos\beta \cos\alpha \\
f_3 &= \cos\beta \cos\gamma + \cos\alpha \sin\beta \sin\gamma - 1 \\
f_4 &= f_2 \sin\beta - (1 + f_3) \cos\beta + 1 \\
f_5 &= f_1 \sin\beta \\
f_6 &= f_1 \cos\beta
\end{aligned}
$$

## üéØ Non-singular Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control

We may introduce the following non-singular sliding surfaces, for $i=1,3,5,7,9,11$:

$$
s_i = e_i + b_i \text{sign}^{\lambda_i}(e_i) + b_i' \text{sign}^{\lambda_i'}(\dot{e}_i)
$$

where $b_i' > 0$, $b_i > 0$, $1 < \lambda_i' < 2$, and $\lambda_i > 1$.  
The tracking errors and their dynamics can be defined as:

$$
e_i = X_i - X_{di}
$$

$$
\dot{e}_i = \dot{X}_i - X_{d(i+1)}
$$

$$
\ddot{e}_i = \ddot{X}_i - \dot{X}_{d(i+1)}
$$

in which:

$$
X_{di} =
\begin{bmatrix}
x_d & \dot{x}_d & y_d & \dot{y}_d & z_d & \dot{z}_d &
\phi_d & \dot{\phi}_d & \theta_d & \dot{\theta}_d &
\psi_d & \dot{\psi}_d
\end{bmatrix}^T
$$

The derivatives of the sliding surfaces can then be calculated, for $k=1,2,3,4,5,6$:

$$
\dot{s}_i =\dot{e}_i \left(1 + b_i \lambda_i |\dot{e}_i|^{\lambda_i - 1}\right)+b_i' \lambda_i' |\dot{e}_i|^{\lambda_i' - 1}\left(f_j + g_{kk} u_k + f_{stj} - \dot{X}_{d(i+1)} \right)
$$

Since the fault vector $f_{st}$ is unknown, the nominal equivalent control law may be obtained, for $j=2,4,6,8,10,12$:

$$
u_{k,eq} =-g_{kk}^{-1} b_i'^{-1} \lambda_i'^{-1}|\dot{e}_i|^{2-\lambda_i'} \text{sign}(\dot{e}_i)\left(1 + b_i \lambda_i |\dot{e}_i|^{\lambda_i - 1}\right)-g_{kk}^{-1}\left(f_j -\dot{X}_{d(i+1)}\right)
$$

For the robustness of the controller against unknown external faults and disturbances, the fast-switching control may be added to the equivalent one:

$$
u_{k,sw} = - g_{kk}^{-1}\left(\eta_k s_i + K_k \text{sign}(s_i)\right)
$$

where $\eta_k$ and $K_k$ are positive constants.  
Hence, the final control law may be derived with the substitution of the estimated faults obtained by the RBFNN:

$$
u_k = - g_{kk}^{-1} \Big[b_i'^{-1} \lambda_i'^{-1} |\dot{e}_i|^{2-\lambda_i'} \text{sign}(\dot{e}_i)\left(1 + b_i \lambda_i |\dot{e}_i|^{\lambda_i - 1}\right)+ f_j+\hat{\omega}_ih_i - \dot{X}_{d(i+1)} + \eta_k s_i + K_k \text{sign}(s_i)\Big]
$$

## üöÄ Optimization

GA is an optimization method based on the principles of natural selection and evolutionary biology. It involves the process of biological evolution by iteratively improving a population of candidate solutions to address a given optimization problem. The minimization of the candidate cost function is utilized in this paper to find the optimal switching and fast parameters of NFTSMC:

$$
J = \int_0^t \Big( \tau e^T P_1 e + u^T P_2 u \Big) \mathrm{d}\tau
$$

where $e$ is the vector of tracking errors, and $P_1$ and $P_2$ are weighting matrices, respectively. The optimization process begins by randomly defining an initial population of potential solutions where each individual denotes a unique set of controller parameters. The individuals are then evaluated based on the cost function, which quantifies the controller's performance. The individuals with smaller values are to be selected for a reproduction process that involves crossover and mutation to generate offspring. New offspring form the new population for the next generation, and the optimization process will be repeated. This cycle of evolution continues until convergence is achieved, indicating that the optimal controller parameters are obtained that best minimize the cost function. The optimal values of fast and switching control parameters obtained by GA are $\eta=0.512$ and $K=8.242$, respectively.
